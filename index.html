        <h2>Reporting</h2>

        <p>If you are being harassed by a member of the Dublin Dribbble Meetup community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one(or more) of those listed below, and the <a href="https://dribbble.com/about">Dribbble HQ team</a>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Stephanie Francis - cloudsteph[at]gmail.com</li>
          <li>Mike McHugh - jymian[at]gmail.com</li>
          <li>Graham Harper - graham[at]hrpr.co</li>

        </ul>

        <p>If you are being harassed by a member of the Dublin Dribbble Meetup community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Dublin Dribbble Meetup community members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The Dublin Dribbble Meetup team reserves the right to exclude people from the Dublin Dribbble Meetup community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Dublin Dribbble Meetup spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Dublin Dribbble Meetup community.</p>

        <p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Dublin Dribbble Meetup members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

        <h2>Consequences</h2>

        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Dublin Dribbble Meetup Team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Dublin Dribbble Meetup spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Dublin Dribbble Meetup members or the general public.</p>
